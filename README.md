This repo tries to reproduce the results of the following paper in PyTorch

- Gal, Y., McAllister, R. and Rasmussen, C.E., 2016, April. Improving PILCO with Bayesian neural network dynamics models. In Data-Efficient Machine Learning workshop, ICML.

However, it is failed to learn a good controller. The purpose of releasing this repo is to encourage if someone interested in to help to seek for potential bugs or check for reproducibility of the algorithm. 

To be consistent with the original paper, I have modified the environment 'CartPole-SwingUp' with same 'physics' coefficients used in the paper.
